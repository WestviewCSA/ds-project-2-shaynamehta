
Design Plan
Due 3/12/25 11:59 PM

After reading the specs, start populating a list of things you think 
have to be done to finish this project 

1) read specs and understand project

	- wolverine knows to stay in limits of grid (does this mean we don't have to code restrictiosn in/)
	- find a path using stack and queue and then find optimal path
	
queue approach 



3/11/25 notes and planning
- start scanner and reading maze text files
 for map system
 need to read characters, determine what they are
read first line of integers in order to determine maze size and quantity
  - then make a 2d array? with the size of the maze and use that to traverse later on

 
 coordinate reading
 - store each coord in Tiles
 - to check for walking access Tile x and Tile y 
 	if x and y have same row index and consectutive col number or vice versa and they have the 
 	same free walkway character, that means it is a viable path
 	- means that when figuring out ig shoudl walk, first check if the characters are the same
